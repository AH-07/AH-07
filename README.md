## Hi there 👋
I'm Ayyub, a self-taught developer learning through YouTube and online resources. I'm currently focused on mastering JavaScript and building projects to grow my front-end skills.
I learned HTML & CSS through SuperSimpleDev and enjoy creating interfaces that are clear, well-structured, and visually intentional.

I come from a Graphic Design background — GCSEs and A Levels — which gives me a strong understanding of layout, typography, and visual hierarchy.
I’m comfortable in Figma, and I mainly work in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for design tasks.

My preferred tools are VS Code, Git/GitHub, and Illustrator. Right now, I'm dedicated to improving as a front-end developer and expanding my JavaScript knowledge.

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out.
